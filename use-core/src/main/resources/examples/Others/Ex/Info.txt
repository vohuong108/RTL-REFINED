This example is the same as Example/Documentation/Demo.
But there is an invariant added and absent comments
in the Ex.use file.

Ex*.cmd == Demo*.cmd

e.cmd: 
== Ex.cmd and a creation of three 
more projects controlled by the department

After executing e.cmd one more invariant evaluates to
false, because there are more projects controlled by the
department than there are employees working for it.
