This example shows the use of two different recursive
operations. One of it does not terminate.
Like /Documentation/NestedOperationCalls the factorial
function is defined here, but without constraints.

RecursiveOperations.use:
one class Rec with two operations

RecursiveOperations.cmd:
one object is created
two operation calls with different arguments
