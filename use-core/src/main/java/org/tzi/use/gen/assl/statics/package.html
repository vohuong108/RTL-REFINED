  <body> Provides classes of the metamodel of ASSL (a snapshot space language).
    The following diagram shows a subset of the classes of this package. Note
    that some specializations are incomplete. <br> <img
	SRC="../../../../../../../../etc/forJavadoc/gen-assl-statics1.gif">
	<br> Subclasses of <code>GInstruction</code> and
	  <code>GValueInstruction</code> not shown in this diagram are commands
	  of <A HREF="../../../../../../../../etc/forJavadoc/assl.ps">ASSL</A>.
	  Their instances are created by the <A
	    HREF="../../../../../../../../etc/forJavadoc/matcherpattern.html">Matcher 
	    pattern</A>. Classes implementing the
	  <code>IGInstructionMatcher</code> interface are the matchers of the
	  pattern. The Creator is <code>GInstructionCreator</code>. The diagram
	  shows how OCL is embedded in ASSL. Some subclasses of
	  <code>GInstruction</code> have associations to classes of the
	  <code>uml.mm</code> package (e.g. <code>GAttributeAssignment</code>,
	  <code>GInstrInsert_Assoc_Linkends</code>). See the constructor of a
	  subclass for details. <p> An instance of this ASSL metamodel should
	    be well typed and consistent to a model
	    (<code>uml.mm.MModel</code>). Consistency and typing are not
	    checked by the constructors or operations of the classes. To get a
	    well typed and consistent instance of the ASSL metamodel, the
	    checks should be done by a package parsing ASSL texts (e.g.
	    <code>org.tzi.use.parser</code>). @see org.tzi.use.parser @see
	    org.tzi.use.uml.mm </body>
