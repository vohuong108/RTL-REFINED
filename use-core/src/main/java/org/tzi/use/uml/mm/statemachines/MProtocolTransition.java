/**
 * A protocol transition (transition as specialized in the ProtocolStateMachines package) 
 * specifies a legal transition for an operation. Transitions of protocol state machines have the following information: 
 * a pre-condition (guard), on trigger, and a post-condition. 
 * Every protocol transition is associated to zero or one operation (referred BehavioralFeature) that belongs
 * to the context classifier of the protocol state machine.
 * <p>
 * The protocol transition specifies that the associated (referred) operation can be 
 * called for an instance in the origin state under the initial condition (guard), 
 * and that at the end of the transition, the destination state will be reached under the final condition (post).
