/**
 * A <i>protocol state machine</i> is always defined in the context of a classifier. 
 * It specifies which operations of the classifier can be called in which state and under which condition, 
 * thus specifying the allowed call sequences on the classifier's operations. 
 * A protocol state machine presents the possible and permitted transitions on the instances of its context
 * classifier, together with the operations that carry the transitions. 
 * In this manner, an instance lifecycle can be created for a classifier, 
 * by specifying the order in which the operations can be activated and the states through which an instance
 * progresses during its existence.
